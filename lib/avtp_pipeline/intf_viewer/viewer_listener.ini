# role: Sets the process as a talker or listener. Valid values are
# talker or listener
role = listener

# stream_addr: Used on the listener and should be set to the 
# mac address of the talker.

# both have this set the same.

# dest_addr: see description in talker.ini
#dest_addr = 91:e0:f0:00:fe:00

# max_interval_frames: The maximum number of packets that will be sent during 
# an observation interval. This is only used on the talker.

# sr_class: A talker only setting. Values are either A or B. If not set an internal 
# default is used.

# sr_rank: A talker only setting. If not set an internal default is used.

# max_transit_usec: Allows manually specifying a maximum transit time. 
# On the talker this value is added to the PTP walltime to create the AVTP Timestamp.
# On the listener this value is used to validate an expected valid timestamp range.
# Note: For the listener the map_nv_item_count value must be set large enough to 
# allow buffering at least as many AVTP packets that can be transmitted  during this 
# max transit time.

# only on the talker.

# max_stale: The number of microseconds beyond the presentation time that media queue items will be purged 
# because they are too old (past the presentation time). This is only used on listener end stations.
# Note: needing to purge old media queue items is often a sign of some other problem. For example: a delay at 
# stream startup before incoming packets are ready to be processed by the media sink. If this deficit 
# in processing or purging the old (stale) packets is not handled, syncing multiple listeners will be problematic.
#max_stale = 1000

# raw_tx_buffers: The number of raw socket transmit buffers. Typically 4 - 8 are good values.
# This is only used by the talker. If not set internal defaults are used.

# raw_rx_buffers: The number of raw socket receive buffers. Typically 50 - 100 are good values.
# This is only used by the listener. If not set internal defaults are used.

# report_seconds: How often to output stats. Defaults to 10 seconds. 0 turns off the stats.
