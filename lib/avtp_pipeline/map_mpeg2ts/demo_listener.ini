# General Listener configuration
#####################################################################
# role: Sets the process as a talker or listener. Valid values are
# talker or listener
role = listener

# stream_addr: Used on the listener and should be set to the 
# mac address of the talker.
stream_addr = 00:25:64:48:ca:a8

# stream_uid: The unique stream ID. The talker and listener must
# both have this set the same.
stream_uid = 1

# dest_addr: When SRP is being used the destination address only needs to
# be set in the talker.  If SRP is not being used the destination address
# needs to be set in both side the talker and listener.
# The destination is a multicast address, not a real MAC address, so it
# does not match the talker or listener's interface MAC.  There are 
# several pools of those addresses for use by AVTP defined in 1722.
# At this time they need to be locally administered and must be in the range
# of 91:E0:F0:00:FE:00 - 91:E0:F0:00:FE:FF.
# Typically :00 for the first stream, :01 for the second, etc.
#dest_addr = 91:e0:f0:00:fe:00

# max_interval_frames: The maximum number of packets that will be sent during 
# an observation interval. This is only used on the talker.
#max_interval_frames = 1

# sr_class: A talker only setting. Values are either A or B. If not set an internal 
# default is used.
#sr_class = B

# sr_rank: A talker only setting. If not set an internal default is used.
#sr_rank = 1

# max_transit_usec: Allows manually specifying a maximum transit time. 
# On the talker this value is added to the PTP walltime to create the AVTP Timestamp.
# On the listener this value is used to validate an expected valid timestamp range.
# Note: For the listener the map_nv_item_count value must be set large enough to 
# allow buffering at least as many AVTP packets that can be transmitted  during this 
# max transit time.
#max_transit_usec = 2000

# internal_latency: Allows mannually specifying an internal latency time. This is used
# only on the talker.
#internal_latency = 0

# raw_tx_buffers: The number of raw socket transmit buffers. Typically 4 - 8 are good values.
# This is only used by the talker. If not set internal defaults are used.
#raw_tx_buffers = 1

# raw_rx_buffers: The number of raw socket receive buffers. Typically 50 - 100 are good values.
# This is only used by the listener. If not set internal defaults are used.
raw_rx_buffers = 50000

# report_seconds: How often to output stats. Defaults to 10 seconds. 0 turns off the stats.

# map_lib: The name of the library file (commonly a .so file) that 
#  implements the Initialize function.  Comment out the map_lib name
#  and link in the .c file to the openavb_tl executable to embed the mapper
#  directly into the executable unit. There is no need to change anything
#  else. The Initialize function will still be dynamically linked in.
