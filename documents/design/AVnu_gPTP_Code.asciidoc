Top level code three components clock, port, message, handling

[[clock-ieee1588clock-class-in-avbts_clock.hppieee1588clock.cpp]]
=== Clock (IEEE1588Clock class in avbts_clock.hpp/ieee1588clock.cpp)

The IEEE1588Clock class is a container for timing functions and state
that is global across all ports.

[[timers]]
==== Timers

The timers API is part of the Clock class and is used to deliver events
to deliver events to Port objects. The event types are:

* STATE_CHANGE_EVENT – causes BMCA algorithm to run +

addEventTimer()/addEventTimerLocked() – add event timer and locks the
underlying OSTimerQueue object in locked version of the call [more
explanation, why]

deleteEventTimer()/deleteEventTimerLocked() – delete event timer and
locks the underlying OSTimerQueue object in locked version of the call

[[selected-methods]]
==== Selected Methods

_setMasterOffset_ – this function updates the frequency and phase
offsets between the 802.1AS grandmaster and the local network device
clock and between the system (e.g. gettimeofday) and local network
clock.[what is this used for?]

This function is called from ptp_message.cpp (code line 1001) when the
port is in PTP_SLAVE mode and followup message is received. It is also
called from ieee1588port.cpp (code line 816) when the port is in
PTP_MASTER mode.

_serializeState_ – this function writes out several clock parameters to
char buffer. This may be used to cache state for faster startup.

The parameters currently cached are: Local device to GM clock offsets,
Local device to System clock offset, GM Identity

_restoreSerializedState_ – this function reads clock parameters that
were previously written out by a call to serializeState

[[port-ieee1588port-class-in-avbts_port.hppieei1588port.cpp]]
=== Port (IEEE1588Port class in avbts_port.hpp/ieei1588port.cpp)

The IEEE1588Port class is a container for per-port state and methods

[[initialization]]
==== Initialization

Initialization of port state is done in the constructor. Much of the
state corresponds closely with the MDPort entity in [1]. The rest of the
initialization, including initializing the OS/device specific
timestamper (HWTimestamper derived object) and network device
(OSNetworkInterface derived object) is completed in init_port which is
called in main. The initialization operation is split in two functions
to accommodate future implementations that require additional OS/device
specific initialization in between. Initialization and the port
operations is started when the POWERUP/INITIALIZE event is received. The
openPort method is started in another thread. This thread processes
incoming messages.

[[selected-methods-1]]
==== Selected Methods

_openPort_ – receives incoming messages and associated timestamps in
while loop. Triggers processing of those messages.

_processEvent_ – processes events received by the port. See section I.a
of this document for message types and associated actions

_serializeState_ – this function writes out several port parameters to
char buffer. This may be used to cache state for faster startup

_restoreSerializedState_ – this function reads port parameters that were
previously written out by a call to serializeState

[[message]]
=== Message

ptp_message.cpp

[[class-ptpmessagecommon]]
==== class PTPMessageCommon

All message types derive from this class. The common methods are:

* _processMessage_ – this code processes a message after it is received
* _sendPort_ – this code transmits a message

[[derived-message-typesclasses]]
==== Derived Message Types/Classes

* PTPMessageSync – represents sync message
* PTPMessageFollowUp – followup message
* PTPMessagePathDelayReq – pdelay request
* PTPMessagePathDelayResp – pdelay response
* PTPMessagePathDelayRespFollowUp – pdelay response followup

[[selected-methods-2]]
==== Selected Methods

_buildPTPMessage_ – when a message buffer is received, this function is
called to parse it. The return value is an object representing the
message or NULL if parsing fails

_buildCommonHeader_ – this function writes the common header information
(see [1] clause 10.5.2 and clause 11.4.2) to a buffer for transmission

_PTPMessageAnnounce::isBetterThan_ – this function compares this object
with that of the argument and returns true if this is better (see
discussion of systemIdentity in [1] clause 10.3.2)

[[sync-transmission-ptp_master-mode]]
==== Sync Transmission (PTP_MASTER mode)

When the SYNC_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRES event (see section I.a of this
document) is received by the port a new PTPMessageSync object is
initialized and transmitted. The transmit timestamp is read from the
timestamper object. A PTPMessageFollowUp object is initialized and the
timestamp is added to the object and transmitted.

*Figure 1. Sync Transmission (PTP_MASTER mode) Sequence Diagram*

[[sync-reception-ptp_slave-mode]]
==== Sync Reception (PTP_SLAVE mode)

When a message of type PTPMessageSync is received it is saved along with
the receive timestamp until either a corresponding message of type
PTPMessageFollowUp (followup) is received or another sync message is
received. When a followup message is received
PTPMessageFollowup::processMessage is executed. The saved sync
information is retrieved and checked. The preciseOriginTimestamp
(remote) is used with the sync timestamp (local) to compute the offset
between the local device clock and the GM clock and calls
IEEE1588Clock::setMasterOffset. Reception of a valid sync and followup
restarts the SYNC_RECEIPT_TIMEOUT timer on the corresponding port
object.

*Figure 2. Sync Reception (PTP_SLAVE mode) Sequence Diagram*

[[pdelay-transmission]]
==== Pdelay Transmission

When the PDELAY_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRES event (see section I.a of this
document) is received by the port a new PTPMessagePathDelayReq object is
initialized and transmitted. The transmit timestamp is read (T1) from
the timestamper object. The request is stored until a response
(PTPMessagePathDelayResp) and response followup
(PTPMessagePathDelayRespFollowUp) is received. The receive timestamp
from the response is captured (T4). The pdelay response and pdelay
response followup messages contain remote timestamps for reception of
the request (T2) and transmission of the response (T3). The link delay
is calculated:

 LD = ((T4-T1)-(T3-T2))/2

The link delay in the Sync Reception operation.

[[pdelay-reception]]
==== PDelay Reception

When a message of type PTPMessagePathDelayReq is received a response
(PTPMessagePathDelayResponse) is initialized, populated with the request
receive timestamp, and transmitted. A response followup
(PTPMessagePathDelayRespFollowUp) is initialized, populated with the
response transmit timestamp, and transmitted.

[[os-abstractions]]
=== OS Abstractions

The OS abstractions are interface definitions where OS specific
implementations are provided in the Linux and Windows directories
providing common OS services (e.g. locking, networking)

* OSCondition (avbts_oscondition.hpp) – condition variable abstraction

* OSNetworkInterface (avbts_osnet.hpp) – network interface abstraction, provides and receive operations

* OSTimerQueue (avbts_ostimerq.hpp) – timer queue interface that allows scheduling of multiple events used for add/delete timer methods in the clock class

* OSTimer (avbts_ostimer.hpp) – timer abstraction providing sleep method that is approximately millisecond accurate

* OSThread (avbts_osthread.hpp) – thread abstraction

* OSLock (avbts_oslock.hpp) – lock abstraction

* HWTimestamper (ieee1588.hpp) – timestamper abstraction providing methods for retrieving transmit and receive timestamps and cross timestamps between the network device clock and the system clock

* OS_IPC (avbts_osipc.hpp) – IPC abstraction used to communicate calculated offsets to other application

[[pdelay-flow-control]]
=== PDelay Flow Control

[[pdelay-transmission-1]]
==== PDelay Transmission

*Initialization:* The Pdelay transaction is initiated in
ieee1588port.cpp by calling IEEE1588Port::startPDelay() from the handler
code for the POWERUP/INITIALIZE port event (located in
IEEE1588::processEvent()). This event is sent from the main() function
in daemon_cl.cpp. The startPDelay() function adds an event of type
PDELAY_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRES by calling
IEEE1588Clock::addEventTimer().

*Transmit Request:* When that event is delivered it is, again, handled
in IEEE1588Port::processEvent(). The PDELAY_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRES
handler code builds a Pdelay message, setting the timestamp to
PDELAY_PENDING_TIMESTAMP, saving the message by calling
IEEE1588Port::setLastPDelayReq(), and transmits the message calling
PTPMessagePathDelayReq ::sendPort(). After transmission is complete, the
pending timestamp is replaced with a valid timestamp. When this
completes a PDELAY_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRES event is requested at the
next Pdelay interval by calling IEEE1588Clock::addEventTimer().

*Receive Response:* The packet receive loop is in
IEEE1588Port::openPort. This code runs in a second thread. Processing of
the PTP message begins in buildPTPMessage(). If parsing is successful,
the processMessage() method is called. For Pdelay responses
PTPMessagePathDelayResp::processMessage() is called for message specific
processing. There isn’t any processing done until the response follow-up
message is received. The Pdelay response and corresponding timestamp is
saved by calling IEEE1588Port::setLastPDelayResp(). When, the Pdelay
response followup is received, the same sequence of calls takes place
with PTPMessagePathDelayRespFollowup::processMessage() being called for
message specific processing. Processing for Pdelay response follow-up
messages validates several message elements (e.g. sequence id, source
identity) and calculates the offset from the peer device. If during
processing a timestamp set to PDELAY_PENDING_TIMESTAMP is encountered,
processing is delayed by scheduling an event of type
PDELAY_DEFERRED_PROCESSING is scheduled. This occurs in the case that
the response from the peer is received before the timestamp is received
from the driver. This is possible because the receive loop runs in its
own thread. That event is handled in IEEE1588::processEvent() and causes
processing to be periodically retried until it is complete.

*Transmit Response:* When a Pdelay request is received processing flows
as above. The message specific processing occurs in
PTPMessagePathDelayReq::processMessage(). A response frame is
constructed containing the receive timestamp corresponding to the
request. The message is transmitted calling
PTPMessagePathDelayResp::sendPort(). A response follow-up is constructed
containing the transmit timestamp corresponding to the response message
and is transmitted.
